\chapter{The reference implementation}

\section{System and package}

The \asdf{} system name for the reference implementation is
\texttt{trucler-reference} and the package name is
\texttt{trucler-reference} as well.

\section{Client and environment}

The reference implementation defines a client class, an instance of
which is to be used to pass as the corresponding \texttt{client}
argument to protocol functions and that class is named
\texttt{client}.

Similarly, the reference implementation defines an environment class that
is used and created by the augmentation methods, and that class is
named \texttt{environment}.

\section{Low-level augmentation functions}

In this section, we describe basic functions for augmenting an
environment, given an old environment and a description.

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {augment-with-variable-description} {client environment description}
}

This function is used to create a new environment object from an
existing environment object and an instance of the class
\texttt{variable-description}.

           {client\\
            (environment {\tt environment})\\
            (description {\tt variable-description})}
}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the
one passed as an argument, except that \textit{description}
will shadow any variable description with the same name.

{\footnotesize

}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the

\section{Merging descriptions}
